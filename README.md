I use yours test branch (master) 
Create new branch from it (TestBranch) 
Add cucumber test in package "cucumberTest"
This is more likely POC, not everything works as I would like to work but I was focusing more on showing concept.
There are missing some functionality, as this is my first time wit Android Studio, espresso and kotlin, so not yet know how to locate everything in virtual app.
